## Platform Overview

HaulAdz is a full-stack, distributed advertising platform for real-time, location-based campaign management and synchronized ad delivery. It consists of:

- **Frontend (Angular Web App):** User/admin interface for campaign, analytics, subscriptions, chat, and more.
- **Backend (Node.js/Express API):** Central business logic, data storage, authentication, payments, notifications, and real-time services.
- **Electron Desktop App:** Dedicated for ad playback in mobile environments, with real-time location filtering, download management, and external display sync.

All components communicate via secure APIs, WebSockets, and IPC (Electron), with shared data models and business rules enforced across the stack.

## Socket Interactions: Real-Time Media and Chat Flows

HaulAdz leverages Socket.IO for real-time communication between the website (frontend), backend, and desktop app (Electron). This enables instant updates for new campaigns/media and seamless chat between users and admins. Below are the two core socket-driven flows:

---

### 1. Real-Time Media/Campaign Delivery

When a new campaign/media is created or approved, the backend emits a socket event to all connected Electron desktop apps. This ensures that the download select page and video play page are always up-to-date with the latest campaigns.

**Relevant files:**
- Electron: `download-select-page.component.ts`, `video-play-page.component.ts`
- Backend: `socketConfig.ts`, campaign controllers/services

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Admin
  participant Backend
  participant ElectronApp as Electron (Download Select/Video Play)

  Admin->>Backend: Approve/Create Campaign (REST)
  Backend->>Backend: Save campaign, update DB
  Backend-->>ElectronApp: emit 'campaign_created' (Socket.IO)
  ElectronApp->>ElectronApp: download-select-page.component.ts receives event
  ElectronApp->>ElectronApp: Add new campaign to list, auto-select for download
  ElectronApp->>ElectronApp: video-play-page.component.ts updates play queue if location matches
```

**Flow Details:**
- When a campaign is created/approved, the backend emits a `campaign_created` event via Socket.IO (see `emitCampaignCreated` in `socketConfig.ts`).
- Electron's `download-select-page.component.ts` listens for this event, adds the campaign to the list, and auto-selects it for download.
- If the campaign is location-relevant, `video-play-page.component.ts` updates its play queue in real time.
- This ensures that new media is available for download and playback without manual refresh.

---

### 2. Real-Time Chat Communication (User â†” Admin)

Both users (via the website) and admins (via the website or Electron) communicate through the same backend socket infrastructure. All chat messages, thread updates, and status changes are propagated in real time.

**Relevant files:**
- Frontend: `admin-chat.component.ts`, `user-chat.component.ts`
- Backend: `ChatController.ts`, `socketConfig.ts`
- Electron: (if chat is implemented, same pattern applies)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UserFE as User (Frontend)
  participant AdminFE as Admin (Frontend)
  participant Backend

  UserFE->>Backend: Send message (REST)
  Backend->>Backend: Save message, update thread
  Backend-->>AdminFE: emit 'new_message_recieved_from_user' (Socket.IO)
  AdminFE->>AdminFE: admin-chat.component.ts receives event, updates UI
  AdminFE->>Backend: Send reply (REST)
  Backend->>Backend: Save message, update thread
  Backend-->>UserFE: emit 'new_message_recieved_from_admin' (Socket.IO)
  UserFE->>UserFE: user-chat.component.ts receives event, updates UI
  Note over Backend: All message status/read events also propagate via socket
```

**Flow Details:**
- Users send messages via REST; backend saves and emits `new_message_recieved_from_user` to all admins (see `emitToAdmin` in `socketConfig.ts`).
- Admins' `admin-chat.component.ts` listens for this event, updating the UI in real time.
- Admin replies are saved and emitted as `new_message_recieved_from_admin` to the user (`emitToUser` in `socketConfig.ts`).
- Users' `user-chat.component.ts` listens for this event, updating the UI instantly.
- Message status updates (delivered/read) and thread status changes are also propagated via socket events, ensuring both parties see real-time feedback.
- All socket authentication and room management is handled in `socketConfig.ts`.

---

**Summary:**
- The backend acts as the real-time hub, emitting events for new campaigns/media and chat messages.
- Electron and frontend clients listen for these events, updating their UI and state instantly.
- This architecture ensures that all users, admins, and devices are always in sync, with no manual refresh required for critical updates.

## Mathematical Logic (KaTeX)

### Haversine Formula for Distance Calculation

The Electron app uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two latitude/longitude points for campaign location filtering:

$$
d = 2r \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\varphi}{2}\right) + \cos(\varphi_1)\cos(\varphi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)}\right)
$$

Where:

- $d$ = distance between two points  
- $r$ = radius of the Earth (mean radius = 6,371 km)  
- $\varphi_1, \varphi_2$ = latitude of point 1 and 2 (in radians)  
- $\Delta\varphi$ = $\varphi_2 - \varphi_1$  
- $\Delta\lambda$ = longitude difference (in radians)
