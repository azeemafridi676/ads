✔ 1. Campaign Creation & Navigation Issue (Problem) @done(25-02-05 20:24)

	•	Bug: The “Create Campaign” button redirects back to the main screen instead of proceeding with campaign setup.
	•	Fix: Ensure users remain in the campaign setup workflow after clicking “Create Campaign.”

☐ 2. Map & Location Selection Issues (Feature: automatic zoom to that specific area alreay doing need zip code and state address for more)

	•	Bug: When a ZIP code or location is entered, the map does not zoom into the selected area.
	•	Fix: Implement automatic map zooming when a client inputs a ZIP code, address, or city.
	•	Bug: Clients struggle to find locations manually.
	•	Fix: Add a drop-down search filter for easier selection by:
	•	Town/City
	•	ZIP Code
	•	State (if applicable)
	•	Bug: Clicking on the map should not change the radius automatically unless the client chooses to modify it using the radius slider feature.
	•	Fix: Ensure that clients can adjust the radius manually while clicking on the map, but the system does not automatically change it unless the slider is used.

☐ 3. Location Management Issues (Client-Side) (Feature: Problem and the locations which are included in campaign which are approved cant be edited)

	•	Bug: Clients cannot edit or delete locations they have selected.
	•	Fix:
	•	Clients should be able to edit or remove locations only before admin approval.
	•	Once the admin approves the campaign, locations are locked and cannot be changed.

✔ 4. Campaign Editing & Management Issues (Problem: Already done have some Problem) @started(25-02-05 20:27) @done(25-02-05 20:47) @lasted(20m44s)

	•	Bug: Clients cannot edit a campaign after it has been created.
	•	Fix: Clients should be able to modify campaign details (such as location, time slots, and duration) before admin approval only.
	•	After approval, the campaign is locked and cannot be changed.
	•	Add a “Copy Campaign” feature so users can duplicate existing campaigns for quick setup.
	•	Add an “Extend Campaign” option so users can increase playtime without creating a new campaign.

Admin Panel Fixes

✔ 5. Approval Messages Not Moving to Completed Section (Problem: Already done) @done(25-02-05 20:47)

	•	Bug: When the admin approves a campaign, the message does not move into the Live or Completed section.
	•	Fix: Ensure that once an admin approves a campaign, the campaign status updates correctly, moving it from pending to “Live” or “Completed.”

Dynamic Subscription System Enhancements

☐ 6. Improved UI for Dynamic Ads & Subscription Selection (Feature: that whole is a new feature)

	•	Fix: The subscription selection page should be redesigned to show the three to four main subscription plans side by side, allowing users to compare features in a single view.
	•	New Process Flow for Clients:
	1.	Step 1: Subscription Selection
	•	Users view all available plans on one page, with a comparison of features (ad playtime, locations, scheduling flexibility, etc.).
	•	They select their preferred subscription before proceeding.
	2.	Step 2: Location Selection
	•	Based on their subscription level, they can either:
	•	Choose from predefined locations.
	•	Enter custom locations (if their plan allows).
	3.	Step 3: Time Slot Selection
	•	If their plan allows, they select time slots (morning, afternoon, night, or specific hours).
	•	If their plan does not allow exact scheduling, they are given pre-set ad slots.
	4.	Step 4: Upgrade Add-Ons
	•	Clients are offered optional upgrades without requiring a full package change.
	•	Example add-ons:
	•	Increase playtime.
	•	Smaller radius for targeted advertising.
	•	Unlock premium time slots.

☐ 7. Subscription-Based Date Selection Rules (Feature: will need Adding new logic to frontend and also backend)

	•	Fix: The admin should be able to control how date selection works per subscription level:
	•	Exclusive & Add-On Plans: Clients can select specific calendar dates for their campaign.
	•	Basic & Shared Plans: Clients can only pick days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
	•	Minimal Filler Ads: Clients do not select dates; ads automatically fill available slots.

☐ 8. Subscription-Based Time Slot Selection Rules (Feature: will need new logic)

	•	Fix:
	•	Separate time slot selection from start and end dates.
	•	New Rules Per Subscription Type:
	•	Basic & Shared Plans:
	•	Cannot select specific times—ads play in predefined general slots:
	•	Morning (6 AM-12 PM)
	•	Afternoon (12 PM-6 PM)
	•	Night (6 PM-12 AM)
	•	Premium & Add-On Plans:
	•	Can select specific time ranges (e.g., 3:30 PM - 9:50 PM).
	•	Minimal Filler Ads:
	•	No time slot selection—ads fill available slots automatically.

☐ 9. Admin-Controlled Date & Time Slot Access Per Subscription (Feature: will need new logic)

	•	Fix: The admin should be able to define which subscriptions allow access to:
	•	Exact date selection vs. weekday selection vs. no date selection.
	•	General time slots vs. specific time ranges vs. no time selection.
	•	Smaller location radius for premium users, while basic plans cover broader areas.

☐ 10. Location Permissions Based on Subscription (Feature: will need new logic)

	•	Fix: Some plans should only allow predefined locations, while premium users can enter custom locations with admin approval.

☐ 11. Stripe Payment & Subscription Upgrades (Feature: will need new logic)

	•	Ensure Stripe handles:
	•	Recurring billing (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
	•	One-time add-ons (extra locations, priority boost, extended playtime).
	•	Subscription modifications (clients should be able to upgrade features without starting a new plan).

Program Automation Updates

☐ 12. Automatic Ad Downloads & Playback on Extended Screens (Problem: in case of offline we eill retry again and again) 

	•	Fix: Ensure that all new ad downloads are automatically triggered when an admin approves a campaign.
	•	Functionality Required:
	•	Once the admin approves a campaign, the program should immediately download the ad content onto the player.
	•	If there is no internet connection, the system should retry downloading until successful.

☐ 13. Automated Video Playback on Extended Screen (Already done)

	•	Fix: Ensure that all downloaded ads automatically play on the extended screen without requiring manual activation.
	•	Functionality Required:
	•	The system should detect new ads and add them to the scheduled rotation automatically.
	•	Ads should begin playback in the correct order based on priority and scheduling without manual input.
