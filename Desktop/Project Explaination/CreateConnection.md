# Create Connection Module (Electron Desktop App)

This document details the logic, structure, and flow of the Create Connection module in the Electron Angular desktop application. It covers the following files:
- create-connection.component.ts
- create-connection.component.html
- create-connection.component.css
- create-connection.component.spec.ts

---

## Purpose

The Create Connection module is responsible for guiding the user through connecting the desktop app to a mobile device running the Traccar Client app. It manages the connection status, displays real-time location updates, and provides step-by-step instructions for setup.

---

## create-connection.component.ts

- **Component Type:** Standalone Angular component.
- **UI Imports:** RouterLink, CommonModule, SpinnerComponent, NavbarComponent.
- **State Variables:**
  - `isConnected`: Boolean, true if the app is connected to the Traccar client.
  - `connectionStatus`: String, either 'Connected' or 'Disconnected'.
  - `serverIp`: String, the IP address of the server (fetched at runtime).
  - `serverPort`: Port number for Traccar (default 8083).
  - `errorMessage`: String, displays error messages to the user.
  - `showConsole`: Boolean, toggles console visibility (not used in template).
  - `latestLocationUpdate`: Object, holds the most recent location data (timestamp, latitude, longitude, speed, bearing, accuracy).
  - `isNewUpdate`: Boolean, triggers a visual highlight for new location updates.
  - `locationSubscription`, `socketTestSubscription`: RxJS Subscriptions for managing observables.
  - `alive`: Boolean, controls the lifecycle of subscriptions.
  - `lastTestEvent`, `testEventCount`: For tracking test events (not used in template).

- **Lifecycle Hooks:**
  - `ngOnInit()`: Fetches server IP and attempts to connect to Traccar on component initialization.
  - `ngOnDestroy()`: Cleans up subscriptions and sets `alive` to false.

- **Connection Logic:**
  - `connectTraccar()`: Calls `electronService.connectTraccar()`. On success, starts location updates. On failure, sets an error message.
  - `disconnectTraccar()`: Calls `electronService.disconnectTraccar()`. On success, updates state and stops location updates. On failure, sets an error message.
  - `toggleConnection()`: Switches between connect and disconnect based on current state.

- **Location Updates:**
  - `startLocationUpdates()`: Subscribes to `electronService.onLocationUpdate()`. On each update:
    - Updates `latestLocationUpdate` and sets `isConnected` to true.
    - Triggers a short visual highlight (`isNewUpdate`).
    - Calls `handleLocationUpdate()` to update the current location in `campaignService`.
  - `stopLocationUpdates()`: Unsubscribes from the location observable.

- **Server IP:**
  - `getServerIp()`: Calls `electronService.getServerIp()` and sets `serverIp`. On failure, sets an error message.

- **UI Controls:**
  - `closeWindow()`, `minimizeWindow()`: Call Electron service methods to control the app window.

- **Integration:**
  - Uses `ElectronService` for all Electron/Traccar-related operations.
  - Uses `CampaignService` to update the current location.
  - Uses `LoggingService` for logging (not shown in this file, but injected).
  - Uses `AuthService` (injected, not used in this file).

- **Logging/Unknown Data:**
  - If the structure of the data returned by `electronService.connectTraccar()`, `electronService.disconnectTraccar()`, or `electronService.onLocationUpdate()` is unclear, insert log statements to capture the full response and error objects at runtime.
  - To clarify, log:
    - The result of `connectTraccar()` and `disconnectTraccar()`
    - The data received in each `onLocationUpdate()` event

---

## create-connection.component.html

- **Layout:**
  - Uses a two-column layout: left for instructions, right for connection status and location data.
  - Includes a custom `<app-navbar>` for window controls (minimize, close).

- **Instructions Section (Left):**
  - Step-by-step guide for connecting the Traccar Client app on a mobile device.
  - Emphasizes that both devices must be on the same network.
  - Displays the server URL using `serverIp` and `serverPort`.
  - Shows error messages if `errorMessage` is set.

- **Status Section (Right):**
  - Shows connection status (Connected/Disconnected) with dynamic styling.
  - Displays the latest location update (timestamp, latitude, longitude, speed, bearing, accuracy) if available.
  - Highlights new updates briefly using the `newest-update` class.
  - "Next" button navigates to `/app/screen-selector`, enabled only if connected. Shows spinner if not connected.

---

## create-connection.component.css

- **.newest-update:**
  - Applies a green background highlight to the latest location update for a short duration when new data arrives.
  - Uses a transition for smooth fade-out.

---

## create-connection.component.spec.ts

- **Test:**
  - Basic test to ensure the component is created successfully.
  - No further logic or UI tests are present.

---

## Integration Points

- Relies on ElectronService for all communication with the Electron main process and Traccar client.
- Updates current location in CampaignService for use elsewhere in the app.
- UI is styled with Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom CSS for update highlighting.
- Uses Angular Router for navigation.
- Uses Angular's standalone component pattern.

---

## Logging and Unclear Data Handling

- If the structure of any data returned by ElectronService methods is unclear, add log statements in the relevant methods and run the app to capture:
  - The full result of `connectTraccar()` and `disconnectTraccar()`
  - The full data object from each `onLocationUpdate()` event
- Provide the following logs for analysis:
  - Output of `connectTraccar()`
  - Output of `disconnectTraccar()`
  - Data received in `onLocationUpdate()`
