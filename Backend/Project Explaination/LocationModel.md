# Location Model Documentation (`locationModel.ts`)

## Overview
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for user locations. Handles location data structure, validation, and timestamp management.

---

## 1. Schema Definition
- Fields: userId, latitude, longitude, locationName, radius, state.
- Field validation: type checks for all fields.

---

## 2. Plugins
- Integrates a custom timestamp plugin to add createdAt and updatedAt fields.

---

## 3. Model Export
- Exports the Locations model for use in other modules.

---

## Notes
- For any unclear schema, plugin, or model logic, insert a log statement and instruct the user to provide:
  - The full object or value returned by the schema, plugin, or model.
  - The values of any relevant variables at the point of logging.
