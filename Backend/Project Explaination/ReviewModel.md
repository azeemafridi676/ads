# Review Model Documentation (`reviewModel.ts`)

## Overview
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for reviews. Handles review data structure, validation, and timestamp management.

---

## 1. Schema Definition
- Fields: user, name, rating, comment, duration, status, date.
- Field validation: required fields, type checks, enum constraints for status, min/max/length constraints for rating and comment.

---

## 2. Indexes
- No explicit indexes defined beyond Mongoose defaults.

---

## 3. Model Export
- Exports the Review model for use in other modules.

---

## Notes
- For any unclear schema or model logic, insert a log statement and instruct the user to provide:
  - The full object or value returned by the schema or model.
  - The values of any relevant variables at the point of logging.
