# Frontend Application Structure Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the logic and flow of the core Angular application files, which serve as the entry point, root configuration, and main routing for the frontend. These files orchestrate module loading, route management, global styles, and application bootstrap.

---

## 1. App Routing Module (`app-routing.module.ts`)
- Defines the main route configuration for the application.
- Maps URL paths to components (e.g., login, signup, home, contact, pricing, dashboard, etc.).
- Uses Angular route guards (e.g., `AuthGuard`) to protect certain routes (dashboard and its children).
- Supports route animations via the `data: { animation: ... }` property.
- Handles fallback for unknown routes by redirecting to the home page.
- Integrates with a shared `content` route array for dashboard subroutes.

---

## 2. App Component HTML (`app.component.html`)
- Contains the root template for the application.
- Wraps the router outlet in a div with a route animation binding (`[@routeAnimations]`).
- The `router-outlet` is where routed components are rendered.

---

## 3. App Component SCSS (`app.component.scss`)
- Sets the root host element to occupy the full width and height of the viewport.
- Applies `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling.

---

## 4. App Component TypeScript (`app.component.ts`)
- Root component of the Angular application.
- Declares the application title.
- Imports and applies the `slideInAnimation` for route transitions.
- Implements `prepareRoute` to extract the animation key from the activated route data for use in the template.

---

## 5. App Module (`app.module.ts`)
- Main module that bootstraps the Angular application.
- Imports all feature modules (ComponentsModule, SharedModule, etc.), Angular core modules, and third-party libraries (Toastr, NgxPermissions, NgRx Store, GSAP, etc.).
- Configures HTTP interceptors, translation loader, and application-wide providers.
- Registers the GSAP initialization service via `APP_INITIALIZER` to ensure animation plugins are ready before app startup.
- Sets up NgRx Store and Effects for state management.

---

## 6. Main Entry Point (`main.ts`)
- Bootstraps the Angular application by loading the `AppModule`.
- Registers GSAP and ScrollTrigger plugins globally before app startup.
- Handles errors during module bootstrap.

---

## Notes
- All routing, animation, and state management logic is modularized and integrated at the root level.
- For any unclear service, provider, or configuration logic, a log statement should be inserted in the relevant file and the user should provide the following log output:
  - The full object or value returned by the service, provider, or configuration.
  - The values of any relevant variables at the point of logging.
